# David Archuleta Jr.

Hello!

My name is David, I have about 10 years of experience as a full stack developer, mostly in Python, PHP, JavaScript.

Things I really love:
* Coding and solving problems in code.
* System design and thinking about how to build scalable, maintainable systems.
* My family and friends!

This is my website: http://darchuletajr.com
Hopefully I will stick to updating it more often from now on.
